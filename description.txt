Welcome to the Cleave Mod! It is effectively a port of the creator, The Him's dungeons and dragons campaign, Quest through Kiplinjar for Terraria. The primary focus is to create enjoyable bossfights that are balanced with vanilla and don't feel mind numbingly easy, nor soul crushingly hard, while also adding weapons, and accessories to combat them. Of course, there are still other features that other mods have such as blocks and enemies, but that is not the focus.
