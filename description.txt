Welcome to the Cleave mod! The main goal is to represent the world of Kiplinjar (made by @Him ) in the form of a mod. The main goal is to add entertaining mechanics and boss fights to use them in that you wouldn't find anywhere else, as well as adding a more cinematic element to the game. Most things are just in a planning phase as of now, but stick around and you might just see something amazing. Enjoy! Do note that a large portion is planned without multiplayer in mind, so don't get your hopes up there.
